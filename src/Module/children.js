        <h2>Helping Kids Cope</h2>
        <p>Emergencies can be particularly stressful for children, who may react in different ways. Helping children cope involves reassuring them and maintaining a sense of security.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Listen to their fears seriously and tell them that it's okay to be scared.</li>
          <li>Explain the events in a way they can understand, acknowledging what is frightening.</li>
          <li>Share what you think and feel, helping them feel less isolated if they know you have similar feelings.</li>
          <li>Maintain familiar routines, like mealtimes and bedtime.</li>
          <li>If needed, talk to a professional like a psychologist or counselor to help children understand and manage their emotions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Did You Know...</h2>
        <p>Younger children may cry or exhibit clinginess during an emergency, while older children may show heightened anxiety, fear of injury, or separation anxiety. Other reactions can include fear of the dark, headaches, and eating or sleeping problems.</p>

        <h2>Teaching Children How to Use 112 (India’s Emergency Number)</h2>
        <p>Knowing how to use emergency services like 112 can be lifesaving. Here are four simple steps to teach children of any age:</p>
        
        <h3>1) Explain What 112 Is</h3>
        <p>Teach children that 112 can be called any time someone is in danger or hurt, or if they feel unsafe. Use concrete examples to help them understand situations that require calling 112, like seeing someone unconscious or witnessing a serious accident.</p>
        <p>For younger children, use simple language: “If you see someone lying on the ground not moving, find an adult. If no one is around, call 112.”</p>
        
        <h3>2) Assess Risks Before Calling 112</h3>
        <p>Teach children that they should call 112 only when they are in a safe location. For example, if there is a fire in a room or in the house, they should leave immediately and then call 112 from outside or a neighbor’s house.</p>
        <p>Explain that 112 is not a game and that unnecessary calls could prevent someone who truly needs help from getting it.</p>
        
        <h3>3) What to Say to 112</h3>
        <p>Explain that when they call 112, they will be asked if they need help from the police, fire department, or medical services.</p>
        <p>For young children, describe each service in simple terms or ask them to say they need help. Teach them to describe the situation and location.</p>
        <p>Encourage them to provide accurate information, starting with their location, name, and contact details.</p>
        
        <h3>4) Practice / Role-play</h3>
        <p>Familiarizing children with emergency scenarios can help reduce panic or anxiety if an actual emergency occurs.</p>
        <p>Create a game with scenarios to help your children practice using 112, adapting the scenarios to their age. Practice multiple times each year.</p>
