      <h1>After an Emergency</h1>
      <p>
        These are general instructions that apply to many emergencies, but every situation is different. These tips 
        can also be useful during an emergency. Refer to specific disaster guides for more tailored advice.
      </p>

      <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Stay calm and composed to make better decisions.</li>
        <li>
          Check yourself and others for injuries. Administer first aid to the injured or trapped. Address life-threatening 
          situations first and seek professional help if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>Check on your neighbours, especially elderly individuals or people with disabilities.</li>
        <li>Secure your pets or confine them to a safe area.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Communication and Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use the battery-operated radio from your emergency kit to stay updated with information and instructions 
          from authorities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid using telephones unless reporting a life-threatening emergency. Keep the lines free for official use.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Safety Precautions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Wear sturdy shoes and protective clothing to prevent injuries from debris, especially broken glass.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are indoors, inspect the building for structural damage. If it appears unsafe, evacuate immediately 
          and do not re-enter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not turn on light switches or light matches until you are sure there are no gas leaks or flammable 
          liquid spills. Use a flashlight to check utilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid shutting off utilities unless they are damaged, leaking, or on fire. For gas leaks, do not attempt 
          to turn the gas back on yourselfâ€”this must be done by a qualified technician.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Water Safety</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If tap water is available, fill bathtubs and containers in case the supply is cut off.</li>
        <li>
          In the absence of running water, use water from hot water tanks, toilet reservoirs, or ice cube trays. 
          Purify the water before use as supplies may be contaminated.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid flushing toilets if you suspect sewer lines are broken.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Elevator and High-Rise Safety</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In high-rise buildings, avoid using elevators in case of power outages.</li>
        <li>If trapped in an elevator, press all floor buttons and exit as soon as it stops.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Child Safety</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pick up your children from school or the pre-determined collection point as soon as possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Avoiding Hazards</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Stay away from damaged areas unless asked to assist or if qualified to do so.</li>
        <li>
          Avoid loose or dangling power lines, as they can cause fires or severe injuries. Report any broken 
          sewer or water mains to the authorities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Food Safety</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the power has been off for several hours, inspect the food in your refrigerator and freezer to ensure 
          it has not spoiled.
        </li>
      </ul>
