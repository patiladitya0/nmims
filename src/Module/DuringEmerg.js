      <h1>During an Emergency</h1>
      <p>
        During an emergency, you may not have time to make alternative plans. It is crucial to know who to call 
        and what to do under different circumstances.
      </p>

      <h2>When to Call Emergency Services (e.g., 112 in India)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Report a fire</li>
        <li>Report a crime</li>
        <li>Save a life</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For non-emergency situations, use the helpline numbers listed by local authorities for police, fire, 
        and paramedic services in your region.
      </p>

      <h2>In Case of a Major Emergency</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow your emergency plan.</li>
        <li>Grab your emergency kit.</li>
        <li>Ensure your safety before assisting others.</li>
        <li>Listen to local radio or TV channels for official updates and follow their instructions.</li>
        <li>Stay where you are unless instructed to evacuate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Major Police Action or Event</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow directions and advice from law enforcement and first responders.</li>
        <li>For your safety, avoid approaching the affected area.</li>
        <li>Unless told to shelter in place, move away from the situation.</li>
        <li>Limit cell phone use to reduce strain on networks.</li>
        <li>Avoid sharing images or videos of law enforcement activities on social media to protect their safety.</li>
        <li>If roads are closed, expect delays and consider alternate routes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Shelter-in-Place</h2>
      <p>
        You may be instructed to "shelter-in-place" if there is a release of harmful substances like chemical, 
        biological, or radiological agents. Follow these steps for maximum safety:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Close and lock all windows and doors.</li>
        <li>Turn off fans, heating, and air-conditioning systems to avoid outdoor air circulation.</li>
        <li>Close the fireplace damper if you have one.</li>
        <li>Get your emergency kit and ensure your radio is working.</li>
        <li>Move to an interior room without windows, preferably above ground level.</li>
        <li>Seal any cracks around doors and vents using duct tape.</li>
        <li>Keep monitoring the radio or TV for updates until told it is safe or instructed to evacuate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Evacuation Orders</h2>
      <p>
        Authorities will only ask you to evacuate if they believe you are in imminent danger. If ordered to evacuate, ensure you take:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your emergency kit and plan.</li>
        <li>Essential medications and their prescriptions.</li>
        <li>A mobile phone (if available).</li>
        <li>Your pets (plan for pet-friendly shelters in advance).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Protect Your Home</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Shut off water and electricity if instructed by officials.</li>
        <li>Do not turn off the gas supply unless explicitly told to do so.</li>
        <li>Secure your home by locking all doors and windows.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Additional Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Inform your out-of-town contact about your plans and expected arrival. Update them once you are safe.
        </li>
        <li>Leave a note at home stating your destination and departure time.</li>
      </ul>
