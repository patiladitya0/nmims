      <h1>Before an Emergency</h1>
      <p>When it comes to emergency preparedness and emergency management, we all have a role to play.</p>
      
      <h2>Individuals and Families</h2>
      <p>
        You should be prepared to take care of yourself and your family for a minimum of 72 hours during an emergency. 
        You should also understand the basic principles of first aid and safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every disaster is a local disaster. Different levels of organizations respond progressively as an emergency 
        escalates and their resources are needed. The first ones to respond are closest to the emergency.
      </p>
      
      <h2>First Responders</h2>
      <h3>Fire, Police, and Paramedics</h3>
      <p>
        Local fire, police, paramedic, and search and rescue teams are normally the first to respond to an emergency. 
        They are responsible for managing most local emergencies as part of the municipal emergency plan. 
        Find out more about the emergency plan in your area by contacting your emergency management organization (EMO).
      </p>
      
      <h2>Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)</h2>
      <p>
        Several non-profit, non-government organizations (NGOs) play very important roles in emergency management, 
        including disaster prevention/mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some examples include NGOs providing first aid training and disaster relief. They work in partnership with 
        governments to help deal with emergencies effectively.
      </p>
      
      <h2>State Governments</h2>
      <p>
        Each state has an emergency management organization (EMO) that manages large-scale emergencies and provides 
        assistance to municipal or community response teams as required. EMOs fulfill an important role in supporting 
        first responders and municipalities.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Central Government</h2>
      <p>
        Central departments and agencies support state-level EMOs as requested. They also manage emergencies that involve 
        areas of central jurisdiction, such as nuclear safety, national defense, and border security.
